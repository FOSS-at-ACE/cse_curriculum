B.Tech. III Year I Sem. L T P C
 3 1 0 4
Prerequisites:
1. A course on “Programming for Problem Solving and Data Structures”.
2. A course on “Advanced Data Structures”.
Course Objectives:
 Introduces the notations for analysis of the performance of algorithms and the data structure of
disjoint sets.
 Describes major algorithmic techniques (divide-and-conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming,
greedy, branch and bound methods) and mention problems for which each technique is appropriate
 Describes how to evaluate and compare different algorithms using worst-, average-, and best case
analysis.
 Explains the difference between tractable and intractable problems, and introduces the problems
that are P, NP and NP complete.
Course Outcomes:
 Analyze performance of Algorithms using Asymptotic Notations
 Design and Analyze the algorithms for solving complex problems using Divide-and-Conquer,
backtracking, Greedy, Dynamic Programming and Branch & Bound Techniques.
 Choose appropriate data structures and algorithm design methods for a specified application
 Explain how the choice of data structures and the algorithm design methods impact the performance of
programs
 Find the optimal solution of complex problems in Graphs
 Develop profound understanding of P,NP,NP-Hard and NP-Complete problems
