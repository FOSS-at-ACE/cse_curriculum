Prerequisites: Programming for Problem Solving
Course Objectives:
 Exploring basic data structures such as stacks and queues.
 Introduces a variety of data structures such as hash tables, search trees, tries, heaps, graphs.
 Introduces sorting and pattern matching algorithms
Course Outcomes:
 Ability to select the data structures that efficiently model the information in a problem.
 Ability to assess efficiency trade-offs among different data structure implementations or
combinations.
 Implement and know the application of algorithms for sorting and pattern matching.
 Design programs using a variety of data structures, including hash tables, binary and general tree
structures, search trees, tries, heaps, graphs, and AVL-trees.
